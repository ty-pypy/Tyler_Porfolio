            <h3 class="tile-subtitle">Problem Solver</h3>
            <p>Dr. Toshinori Hoshi (University of Pennsylvania) is always juggling multiple experiments and 
                projects simultaneously. Those that work in his lab help to maintain the quick-paced tempo and
                are expected to break through all obstracles as they come. In his lab, and research in general,
                most time is spent finding and correcting issues through continuous repetition and single variable
                manipulation. <br>
                Working with other labs also aided in finding different approaches or new techniques.
                Learning to use the High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) instrument in the Yale Goldman
                lab, (thanks to Jody Dantzig!) finally produced the definitive results that our lab was looking
                for for over a year.
            </p>

            <h3 class="tile-subtitle">Team Player</h3>
            <p>Jefferson University Hosptial, Stratford, has a strong and intelligent workforce. Being a part of
                the pharmacy meant keeping up with the demands of all the units including the ER, ICU, Surgery
                Department and all the other units of the hospital. Since the pharmacy team was small, each person
                had the opportunity to lend a hand to ensure the proper medications were dispensed to the different
                units safely and promptly. This included staying over the time, breaking from your designated job
                and running to different units at a moments notice.
            </p>

            <h3 class="tile-subtitle">Curious, Passtionate About Learning, Strives to Improve</h3>
            <p>Since research is not so straight-forward, there is a variety of tools and techniques to help. In Dr. Hoshi's
                lab, he offered the freedom to incorporate new tools, processes and techniques as long as they were well 
                researched and had a reasonable cost. I was able to introduce several new techniques into the lab that 
                provided results that were lacking, or provided a clearer result than before.
            </p>

            <h3 class="tile-subtitle">Autonomous</h3>
            <p>Dr. Hoshi's lab and completing my Computer Science degree demanded a high level of self disciple. The lab
                was smaller when I was a member and required the ability to resolve issues and develop experiments and 
                procedures independently. My degree was completely online and self-paced, therefore a great level of 
                responsibility was placed on my lap.
