                <p>This dashboard allows a user to see mortality data that was processed from a dataset published by the Center for 
                    Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Chronic Disease Indicators dataset. The data was parsed for information 
                    pertaining to noncanerous mortalities and processed for visualization.

                <p>The goal of this project was to use a combination of data structures and algorithms that would address a Traveling
                    Salesman derived problem. The program delivers all the packages to the designated locations via a greedy algorithm 
                    (with the help of Dijkstra's algorithm) and follows package delivery specifications.

                <h4>Full Stack, Model-View-Controller, GUI, CRUD, Login</h4>
                <p>The goal of this project was to create a fully functioning Customer Relations
                    Manager in which the user can log in, and see all customer and appointments 
                    pertaining to them. The user is able to create new customers and update or delete 
                    existing ones. All activity is saved to a database.

                <h4>Model-View-Controller, Classes, Inheritance, Encapsulation, GUI </h4>
                <p>The goal of this project was to build a graphical user interface (GUI) in which
                    a user would be able to create, read, update, and delete components that were 
                    classified as either parts or products. The GUI was not connected to a database 
                    though and any events that occur while using it will not be saved.

                <p>The goal of this project was to parse an array of information pertaining to 
                    students, build instances and assemble them into a roster. The roster can be
                    filtered to find specific information and remove students as needed.
